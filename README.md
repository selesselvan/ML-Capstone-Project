# Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2024 - Capstone Project ML [^1]

# Overview

Air pollution occurs when harmful chemical, physical, or biological substances contaminate the air, disrupting its natural composition. Major sources include household appliances, vehicles, industrial activities, and forest fires. Key pollutants like particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide pose serious risks to public health. This pollution, both indoors and outdoors, significantly contributes to respiratory diseases and other health problems, resulting in high rates of illness and death globally.

For this capstone project, a dataset from Kaggle [^2], originally collected from eLichens, was utilized to develop an AQI classification model. The model addresses the critical need for air quality monitoring and public health risk assessment. Considering the severe health risks posed by air pollution, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, the classification of air quality into actionable categories (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) was prioritized to facilitate timely interventions. This solution also supports public awareness campaigns, promoting cleaner practices and policies to combat air pollution globally. Additionally, the model can be integrated into mobile applications or smart devices to alert individuals about current air quality levels, helping them make informed decisions to protect their health.

# About Dataset

## Dataset Overview:
The Global Air Pollution Dataset contains 23,463 rows and 12 columns, offering a detailed collection of air quality data from diverse locations worldwide.

## Key Features of the Dataset:
This dataset provides geolocated information about the following pollutants [^2]:

- Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2]: Nitrogen Dioxide is one of the several nitrogen oxides. It is introduced into the air by natural phenomena like entry from the stratosphere or lighting. At the surface level, however, NO2 forms from cars, trucks and buses emissions, power plants and off-road equipment. Exposure over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases like asthma. Longer exposures may contribute to the development of asthma and respiratory infections. People with asthma, children and the elderly are at greater risk for the health effects of NO2.

- Ozone [O3]: The Ozone molecule is harmful to outdoor air quality (if outside of the ozone layer). At the surface level, ozone is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Differently from the good ozone located in the upper atmosphere, ground-level ozone can provoke several health problems like chest pain, coughing, throat irritation and airway inflammation. Furthermore, it can reduce lung function and worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ozone also affects vegetation and ecosystems. In particular, it damages sensitive vegetation during the growing season.

- Carbon Monoxide [CO] : Carbon Monoxide is a colourless and odourless gas. In the outdoors, it is emitted into the air by cars, trucks, and other vehicles or machinery that burn fossil fuels. Such items like kerosene gas space heaters and gas stoves also release CO, affecting indoor air quality. Breathing air with a high concentration of CO reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the bloodstream to critical organs like the heart and brain at very high levels, which are not likely to occur outdoors but are possible in enclosed environments. CO can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death.

- Particulate Matter [PM2.5]: Atmospheric Particulate Matter, also known as atmospheric aerosol particles, are complex mixtures of small solid and liquid matter that get into the air. If inhaled, they can cause serious heart and lung problems. They have been classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). PM10 refers to those particles with a diameter of 10 micrometres or less. PM2.5 refers to those particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less.

# Project Components

This project includes several key components that are part of machine-learning-zoomcamp [^3] capstone project requirements (Evaluation Criteria):

- Problem Description
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training
- Exporting Notebook to Script
- Model Deployment
- Reproducibility
- Dependency and Environment Management
- Containerization


# Dependency and Environment Management Guide

Set up and activate virtual environment and install dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

1. To create a virtual environment named "cap" (could be any name) in your current directory.
      
      - ```bash
        python -m venv cap
        
2. To activate the Virtual Environment 

      On Windows: 
      - ```bash
        cap\Scripts\activate
      
      On macOS/Linux:
      - ```bash
        source cap/bin/activate

 3. Install Dependencies from requirements.txt.
    
     Ensure the requirements.txt file is in the same directory where you’re working, then run:
      - ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt

  4. To confirm that the dependencies were installed correctly, run:
       - ```bash
         pip freeze

  5. To exit the virtual environment, run:
       - ```bash
         deactivate

# Deployment Guide

## To Run Locally:

Run "predict.py" file in a terminal to start the Flask API.
  - ```bash
    python predict.py
    
Open another terminal window and run the Streamlit application[Ensure the Flask API (predict.py) is running on http://localhost:9696 before clicking the "Predict AQI Category" button]
  - ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

-- Enter values in the input fields and click "Predict AQI Category" to test the prediction functionality.    

## To Run with Docker:

- Download and run Docker Desktop from the official website: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Open the terminal of your project
- Build the Docker image:
  ```bash
   docker build -t aqi-predictor 

- Run the Docker container:
  ```bash
   docker run -p 9696:9696 -p 8501:8501 aqi-predictor

* Exposes ports 9696 (for Flask) and 8501 (for Streamlit).
* Runs both the Flask app (predict.py) and the Streamlit app (app.py) when the container starts.

# Local Deployment
